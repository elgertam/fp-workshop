# Functional Programming in JavaScript

A short set of challenges to introduce functional instead of
imperative programming in JavaScript. Start with the `01-map` exercise
and go in order. You can click on the "edit on jsbin" link in each exercise to get an interactive jsbin for working. It already includes underscore.

The answers are in `answers.md`.
